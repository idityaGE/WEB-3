# Ethereum

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform that enables smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes.

## History of Ethereum

- **Conceptualization (2013)**: Ethereum was first described by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and cryptocurrency researcher. He proposed the idea after realizing Bitcoin's limitations for building applications.

- **Whitepaper (Late 2013)**: Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper describing a platform for decentralized applications.

- **Development Team Formation (2014)**: Buterin assembled a team including Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Joseph Lubin among others.

- **Crowdsale (July-August 2014)**: Early funding was secured through a public crowdsale of Ether tokens.

- **Launch (July 30, 2015)**: The Ethereum mainnet went live with the "Frontier" release.

- **The DAO Hack and Fork (2016)**: A major hack of "The DAO" project led to a controversial hard fork, splitting Ethereum into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

- **The Merge (2022)**: Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, significantly reducing energy consumption.

## High-Level Differences

### Ethereum vs. Bitcoin

1. **Purpose**:
   - Bitcoin: Primarily designed as a decentralized digital currency
   - Ethereum: A platform for building decentralized applications and executing smart contracts

2. **Programmability**:
   - Bitcoin: Limited scripting capabilities
   - Ethereum: Fully programmable with Turing-complete smart contracts

3. **Transaction Speed**:
   - Bitcoin: ~7 transactions per second
   - Ethereum: ~15-30 transactions per second (base layer)

4. **Consensus**:
   - Bitcoin: Proof of Work
   - Ethereum: Transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake

### Ethereum vs. Solana

1. **Transaction Speed**:
   - Ethereum: ~15-30 TPS on base layer (higher with Layer 2 solutions)
   - Solana: Claims up to 65,000 TPS

2. **Consensus**:
   - Ethereum: Proof of Stake
   - Solana: Proof of History combined with Proof of Stake

3. **Development Ecosystem**:
   - Ethereum: Mature ecosystem with thousands of dApps and developers
   - Solana: Growing ecosystem, particularly strong in DeFi and NFTs

4. **Decentralization**:
   - Ethereum: Higher level of decentralization with over 400,000 validators
   - Solana: Fewer validators, higher hardware requirements

5. **Smart Contract Languages**:
   - Ethereum: Primarily Solidity
   - Solana: Rust, C, C++
